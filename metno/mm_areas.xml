First very simple description...
Use hidden to identify common mis spellings...
Check what is available through GCMD and ICES, potentially also INSPIRE.
Ideally a geoJSON identification of a polygon providing boundaries should be
added in the future.
Should these keywords indicate hierarchy? The Barents Sea is part of the
Arctic etc...

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
    Controlled vocabulary to be used in METAMOD context to describe
    geographical areas. This should be related to GCMD science keywords
    through altLabel. The definition should contain a unique specification
    of the area. Historically, METAMOD started out with ocean areas only.
    Open issues remain on how to best classify land regions.
