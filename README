Scientific Vocabularies (scivocab)
###########################################################

The purpose of this repository is to generate geoscientific controlled
vocabularies that are useful for distributed data management within
meteorology and oceanography. Some vocabularies exist, but are not
available in machine readable form. These are then implemented in XML
(preferably in SKOS). 

It is the plan to implement linkages between vocabularies as well.

Useful vocabularies that are available in SKOS at other locations are
Global Change Master Directory keywords and Climate and Forecast standard
names. These are not included here.
